PERSONAL STATEMENT
I’m a technical support engineer with experience in software development, troubleshooting technical bugs, and
working in code every day. With over 3 years of experience in technical support and software development, I have
used my passion for troubleshooting in my work. From vulnerability remediation in full-stack web application code to
providing tier 3 support for a SaaS application. I have contributed to full-stack new production features in a TypeScript
React front-end and a Spring Boot back-end. I participated in the entire bug lifecycle, from working directly with
customers to troubleshoot and identify production bugs to implementing and pushing the fix to production. I have
excelled in my role as a US team lead where I constantly sought to improve and automate processes. I thrive in an
environment where I can grow and be challenged and find ways to solve difficult problems with creative solutions.
